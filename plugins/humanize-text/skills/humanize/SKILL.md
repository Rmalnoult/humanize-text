  Apply human writing rules to text content. Use this skill proactively whenever you write or edit
  user-facing text: landing pages, blog posts, marketing copy, UI strings, documentation, README files,
  emails, product descriptions, or any prose meant for humans to read. Also use when the user runs /humanize
  on a file to review and fix existing text.
---

Review the text and fix every violation of these rules. When writing new text, follow them from the start.

## Voice anchor

Before writing, pick a voice and stick with it for the entire piece:

- A practitioner sharing what they learned the hard way
- A friend explaining something over coffee
- A skeptic who's been burned before but found something that works
- A reporter stating facts without editorializing

Inconsistent tone is an AI tell. One voice, start to finish.

## Banned words and phrases

These are statistical markers that AI detectors flag. Replace them with plain language.

**Corporate filler:** delve, utilize, leverage, facilitate, optimize, implement, robust, seamless, scalable, cutting-edge, innovative, transformative, groundbreaking, game changer, paradigm shift, synergy, elevate, streamline, bolster, underscore, illuminate, endeavor, catalyze, galvanize

**Faux-inspirational:** unlock the potential, unleash the power, harness the power, embark on a journey, navigate the complexities, a testament to, pave the way, at the forefront, push the boundaries, bridge the gap, foster a culture, spearhead, forge new paths, forge ahead

**Hedging (commit or delete the sentence):** it's important to note, it's worth mentioning, it should be noted, it's worth considering, generally speaking, in many cases, depending on the context, as previously mentioned, as noted above

**Overused transitions:** furthermore, moreover, additionally, indeed, subsequently, accordingly, consequently, nevertheless, whilst, that said, having said that

**Overused adjectives:** crucial, pivotal, profound, comprehensive, enhanced, notable, poignant, multifaceted, nuanced, intricate, meticulous, paramount, myriad, burgeoning, nascent

**Dead giveaway openers:** in today's fast-paced world, in the ever-evolving landscape, in the realm of, here's a comprehensive overview, let me break this down, let's dive in, let's explore, let's take a look, when it comes to

**Dead giveaway closers:** in conclusion, to summarize, overall (as paragraph opener), I hope this helps, feel free to reach out, the key takeaway is, at the end of the day

**Sycophancy:** great question, that's a great point, you're absolutely right, as you probably already know, you might be wondering, given your expertise, excellent observation

**Overused nouns:** landscape, tapestry, interplay, realm, juxtaposition, plethora, advent, cornerstone, underpinning

**Banned patterns (not just words):**
- "This is not just X, it's Y" (AI's favorite rhetorical frame)
- "From X to Y" as a range opener ("From startups to enterprises")
- "Whether you're X or Y" (false inclusivity)
- "X, and here's why" (clickbait framing)
- "Think of it as X" (patronizing analogy intros)

**Vocabulary swaps:** use "show" not "showcase", "said" not "remarked", "fits" not "aligns with", "beats" not "surpasses", "affects" not "impacts" (as verb), "use" not "utilize/leverage", "help" not "empower", "change" not "transform", "improve" not "enhance", "works with" not "integrates seamlessly"

## Punctuation

- **Em dashes: replace them.** Use commas, periods, or colons instead. Keyboards don't have an em dash key. Real people don't type them.
- **Contractions: always.** "you'll" not "you will", "don't" not "do not", "here's" not "here is", "it's" not "it is", "we're" not "we are". Uncontracted text reads robotic.
- **Fragments are fine.** Start sentences with "And" or "But" sometimes. Skip the subject occasionally. Like this.
- **Semicolons:** sparingly, only when the connection between clauses is genuinely tight.

## Headings and titles

- **Sentence case everywhere.** Capitalize the first word and proper nouns only. Not "How To Create Real Estate Videos" but "How to create real estate videos."
- Exception: very short button labels (3-4 words) and brand names.
- Be consistent across the entire page.

## Structural tells

AI has structural patterns beyond word choice. Break them.

- **The triple pattern.** AI loves listing three things: "faster, smarter, and more efficient." Two is fine. Four is fine. Three every time is a tell.
- **Mirror structure.** AI writes parallel sentences: "X does Y. A does B. M does N." Break the parallelism.
- **The qualifying opener.** "While X is true, Y is also important." Rewrite as two direct sentences.
- **Enumeration addiction.** AI turns everything into numbered lists or bullet points. Use prose. Tell a story. Make an argument.
- **The balanced take.** AI always presents "both sides." Sometimes one side is right. Say so.
- **Connector density.** AI uses a transition word in nearly every sentence. Real writing has sentences that just start. No "however." No "that said." Just the next thought.
- **The setup-payoff pair.** "You might think X. But actually, Y." Once per piece, fine. Every other paragraph, it's a crutch.

## Predictability

AI picks the statistically likely next word. Humans don't.

- **Surprise the reader.** Use unexpected comparisons or references. Not "a powerful tool" but "a Swiss Army knife for lazy marketers."
- **Vary register.** Mix formal with casual in the same piece. One sentence is precise. The next is conversational. That's how people actually talk.
- **Imperfect is human.** A parenthetical aside (like this one) or a self-correction mid-thought reads as authentic.
- **Domain-specific vocabulary.** Use the words your audience actually uses. "Bounce rate" not "the rate at which visitors leave." Insiders talk like insiders.
- **Specific over generic.** Not "a significant improvement" but "cut load time from 4.2s to 800ms." Details are hard to fake.

## Sentence and paragraph rhythm

- **Vary sentence length aggressively.** Mix 4-word sentences with 25-word ones. Short sentence. Then a longer one that builds and adds detail. Then short again. AI writes every sentence at 15-20 words.
- **Break the Subject-Verb-Object pattern.** Use fragments. Start with a dependent clause. Ask a question.
- **Vary paragraph length.** Some paragraphs: one sentence. Others: four or five. AI makes every paragraph 3-4 sentences.
- **Different paragraph openers.** Start with a question, an anecdote, a bold claim, or just continue the thought from the previous paragraph.

## Tone

- Write to one person. "you" and "your" constantly.
- Have a point of view. Take positions. Say "this is better" not "this could potentially be considered."
- Specific numbers and details. Not "many agents" but "2,847 agents." Not "fast" but "4 minutes."
- Active voice. "We render your video" not "your video is rendered."
- Read it aloud in your head. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it.
- Acknowledge trade-offs. It builds trust.
- Skip the enthusiasm. No exclamation marks in body copy unless you're genuinely excited.

## Structure

- Don't announce what you're about to say. Just say it.
- Don't summarize what you just said. The reader just read it.
- Limit bullet points. When prose works, use prose.
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature. Not "AI-powered rendering engine" but "your video, ready in 5 minutes."
- Cut the intro paragraph. Start with the first useful sentence.

## SEO (blog posts and landing pages)

- Target keyword in: title, first 50 words, URL slug, meta description, and 1-2 subheadings.
- Use related terms and synonyms naturally instead of repeating the exact keyword.
- FAQ sections with questions people actually search for.
- Sentence case for all heading tags.
- Specific, experience-based content ranks higher than generic text.

## Examples

**AI wrote this:**
> It's important to note that leveraging this robust platform can help you
> navigate the complexities of video rendering — ultimately streamlining
> your workflow and delivering transformative results.

**A human wrote this:**
> You upload a script. Four minutes later, you've got a finished video.
> No editing. No timeline. Just done.

---

**AI wrote this:**
> This groundbreaking solution seamlessly integrates with your existing
> tools, empowering teams to unlock their full potential and drive
> innovative outcomes across the organization.

**A human wrote this:**
> It plugs into Slack and Notion. Your team won't need to learn anything
> new. We tested it with a 12-person marketing team in Lyon, and they
> shipped their first campaign the same afternoon.

---

**AI wrote this:**
> In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses must navigate the
> complexities of online presence. Furthermore, it's worth noting that a
> comprehensive SEO strategy is crucial for sustainable growth.

**A human wrote this:**
> Most SEO advice is recycled garbage. We tracked 200 SaaS blogs for six
> months. The ones that ranked had one thing in common: they answered
> specific questions with specific numbers. That's it.

## When running /humanize on existing files

1. Read the file completely.
2. **Voice check.** Does this sound like one consistent person wrote it? Flag tonal shifts.
3. **Violation scan.** List every violation (grouped by category, with line numbers).
4. **Predictability check.** Read three consecutive sentences. Could you predict the third from the first two? If yes, rewrite.
5. **Structure check.** Count consecutive triple patterns, parallel constructions, and transition-heavy sentences. Flag clusters.
6. Apply all fixes in a single pass using Edit.
7. Re-read aloud. If any sentence sounds like it came from a press release, rewrite it.
