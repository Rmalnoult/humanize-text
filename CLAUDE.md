# Writing rules — applied to ALL text output

When writing or editing user-facing text (landing pages, blog posts, marketing copy, UI strings, documentation, README files, emails), follow these rules strictly. These override your default writing patterns.

## Banned words and phrases

Never use these. They are AI tells that destroy credibility.

**Corporate filler:** delve, utilize, leverage, facilitate, optimize, implement, robust, seamless, scalable, cutting-edge, innovative, transformative, groundbreaking, game changer, paradigm shift, synergy, elevate, streamline

**Faux-inspirational:** unlock the potential, unleash the power, harness the power, embark on a journey, navigate the complexities, a testament to, pave the way, at the forefront, push the boundaries, bridge the gap, foster a culture, spearhead

**Hedging (commit to something or delete the sentence):** it's important to note, it's worth mentioning, it should be noted, it's worth considering, generally speaking, in many cases, depending on the context

**Overused transitions:** furthermore, moreover, additionally, indeed, subsequently, accordingly, consequently, nevertheless, whilst

**Overused adjectives:** crucial, pivotal, profound, comprehensive, enhanced, notable, poignant, multifaceted

**Dead giveaway openers:** in today's fast-paced world, in the ever-evolving landscape, in the realm of, here's a comprehensive overview, let me break this down

**Dead giveaway closers:** in conclusion, to summarize, overall (as paragraph opener), I hope this helps, feel free to reach out

**Vocabulary swaps:** use "show" not "showcase", use "said" not "remarked", use "fits" not "aligns with", use "beats" not "surpasses", use "affects" not "impacts" (as verb)

## Punctuation

- **Em dashes:** max 1-2 per full page. Replace most with commas, periods, or colons. Keyboards don't have an em dash key — real people rarely type them.
- **Contractions:** always use them. Write "you'll" not "you will", "don't" not "do not", "here's" not "here is", "it's" not "it is", "we're" not "we are". Formal uncontracted text reads robotic.
- **Fragments are fine.** Start sentences with "And" or "But" sometimes. Skip the subject occasionally. Like this.
- **Semicolons:** use sparingly and only when the connection between clauses is genuinely tight. Never chain them.

## Headings and titles

- **Sentence case everywhere.** Capitalize the first word and proper nouns only. Not "How To Create Real Estate Videos" but "How to create real estate videos."
- Exception: very short button labels (3-4 words) and brand names.
- Never ALL CAPS for full headings.
- Be consistent across the entire page.

## Sentence and paragraph rhythm

- **Vary sentence length aggressively.** Mix 4-word sentences with 25-word ones. Short sentence. Then a longer one that builds and adds detail. Then short again. AI writes metronomically — every sentence 15-20 words. Don't.
- **Never write 3+ consecutive sentences of similar length.** If you catch yourself doing it, break one up or merge two.
- **Break the Subject-Verb-Object pattern.** Use fragments. Start with a dependent clause. Ask a question. Don't just march through SVO over and over.
- **Vary paragraph length.** Some paragraphs: one sentence. Others: four or five. AI makes every paragraph 3-4 sentences. Don't.
- **Don't open every paragraph the same way.** Not every paragraph needs a topic sentence. Start with a question, an anecdote, a bold claim, or just continue the thought from the previous paragraph.

## Tone

- Write to one person. Use "you" and "your" constantly. Never "users", "individuals", or "one."
- Have a point of view. Take positions. Say "this is better" not "this could potentially be considered."
- Use specific numbers and details. Not "many agents" but "2,847 agents." Not "fast" but "4 minutes."
- Active voice always. "We render your video" not "your video is rendered."
- Read it aloud in your head. If it sounds like a press release or a textbook, rewrite it.
- No relentless positivity. Acknowledge trade-offs, be honest about limitations. It builds trust.

## Structural rules

- Don't announce what you're about to say. Just say it. No "in this section, we'll explore..."
- Don't summarize what you just said. The reader just read it.
- Limit bullet points. Not every section needs a list. When prose works, use prose.
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature. Not "AI-powered rendering engine" but "your video, ready in 5 minutes."

## SEO (for blog posts and landing pages)

- Target keyword in: title, first 50 words, URL slug, meta description, and 1-2 subheadings. Never stuff.
- Use related terms and synonyms naturally instead of repeating the exact keyword.
- FAQ sections with questions people actually search for.
- Sentence case for all H1/H2/H3 tags.
- Specific, experience-based content ranks higher than generic commodity text.

## What to do when you notice a violation

If you're editing or writing a file and notice existing text that violates these rules, fix it inline. Don't leave AI-sounding text in place just because it was already there.
